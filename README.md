Azure Data Factory (ADF) can be used to integrate real-time data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices and web APIs using its ability to perform data transformations and ingestion into various data stores such as Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure SQL Database, and more.

Here is a high-level example of the use case:

1. IoT devices generate real-time data and send it to Azure IoT Hub.
2. ADF is triggered by a message arriving in the IoT Hub and extracts the data from the message.
3. ADF performs transformations on the data, such as data cleansing and enrichment, if necessary.
4. ADF loads the transformed data into a data lake or data warehouse for analysis and reporting.
5. Web API data can also be ingested into ADF using REST API calls and can be transformed and loaded into the same data lake or data warehouse.

This use case enables organizations to collect, store, and analyze real-time data from IoT devices and web APIs in a centralized location, allowing for a more comprehensive view of their data and improved decision making.
