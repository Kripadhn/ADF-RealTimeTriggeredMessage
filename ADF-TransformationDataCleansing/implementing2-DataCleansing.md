To perform data cleansing in Azure Data Factory using the "Copy" activity, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new pipeline in Azure Data Factory and add a "Copy" activity to it.

2. Define the source and sink for the data. For example, if the data is coming from an IoT Hub, the source could be the IoT Hub, and if the data is being stored in a Data Lake Store, the sink could be the Data Lake Store.

3. In the "Copy" activity, define the transformations to be performed on the data. For example, to cleanse the data, you can use expressions to remove any invalid or unwanted data.

Here is an example code snippet that removes rows with negative values in a column named "Temperature":

4. Save the pipeline definition and execute the pipeline. The data will be cleansed during the copying process, and the cleansed data will be available in the Data Lake Store at the specified file location.

Please note that the above code is just a sample and is not guaranteed to run without modifications. Depending on the specific requirements, you may need to make changes to the pipeline definition, the transformations, and the data source/sink to meet the specific needs of your use case.

5. You can also add additional transformations to the pipeline as needed. For example, you can use the "Derived Column" transformation to create new columns based on the data in existing columns, or use the "Aggregate" transformation to aggregate data based on certain columns.

Here is an example code snippet that adds a new column "TemperatureF" to the data, which is the temperature in Fahrenheit:

6. You can also add additional sink destinations if you want to store the cleansed data in multiple locations. For example, you can copy the data to an Azure SQL Database, a Power BI data set, or another Data Lake Store.

7. Once the pipeline is configured, you can run it on a schedule, or trigger it manually, to cleanse the data from the IoT Hub in real-time. You can monitor the pipeline execution to ensure that the data is being cleansed and transformed as expected.

8. To enhance the pipeline and make it more robust, you can add error handling mechanisms. For example, you can add a "For Each" loop that iterates over a list of input files, and perform the cleansing and transformations for each file. In case of any errors, you can log the errors and skip the problematic file, and continue with the next file.

9. Finally, you can publish the transformed data to a destination of your choice, such as an Azure SQL database, a Power BI dataset, or a data lake. You can use the "Copy" activity in ADF to copy the transformed data from the source to the destination.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to publish the transformed data to an Azure SQL database:

10. Finally, you can schedule the ADF pipeline to run at a specific interval or trigger it on-demand. To schedule the pipeline, you can use the "Trigger" feature in ADF. You can set the trigger to run the pipeline daily, weekly, or monthly, or at a specific time of the day.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to set up a daily trigger for the ADF pipeline:

In conclusion, using Azure Data Factory, you can effectively integrate real-time data from IoT devices, perform transformations, and publish the data to a destination of your choice. With the power of ADF, you can easily build scalable, flexible, and efficient data integration pipelines that meet your business needs.

11. After setting up the pipeline, you can monitor the pipeline's execution status and view the pipeline's history and performance metrics. In ADF, you can use the "Monitor & Manage" feature to monitor your pipelines and detect any errors or failures. You can also set up alerts to notify you in case of any failures or issues.

12. Additionally, you can use the "Integration Runtimes" feature in ADF to manage the resources and compute power required to run the pipelines. You can choose from a variety of resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines or Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime, to run your pipelines.

13. Another important aspect of the integration of IoT data is data security. In ADF, you can ensure the security of your data at rest and in transit by using encryption and secure communication protocols. You can also control access to your data by using Azure Active Directory and setting up role-based access controls.

14. Finally, it's important to consider the cost of the integration solution. Azure Data Factory offers a cost-effective solution for data integration, as you only pay for the resources and services you use. You can also optimize costs by using Azure resources, such as Azure Functions, that are billed based on usage, instead of paying for dedicated resources.

In conclusion, the integration of real-time data from IoT devices into Azure Data Factory is a powerful and cost-effective solution for data integration and processing. With ADF, you can build scalable, secure, and flexible pipelines for real-time data processing, analysis, and reporting.
