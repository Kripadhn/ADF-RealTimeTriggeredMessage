To perform data cleansing in Azure Data Factory using the "Copy" activity, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new pipeline in Azure Data Factory and add a "Copy" activity to it.

2. Define the source and sink for the data. For example, if the data is coming from an IoT Hub, the source could be the IoT Hub, and if the data is being stored in a Data Lake Store, the sink could be the Data Lake Store.

3. In the "Copy" activity, define the transformations to be performed on the data. For example, to cleanse the data, you can use expressions to remove any invalid or unwanted data.

Here is an example code snippet that removes rows with negative values in a column named "Temperature":

4. Save the pipeline definition and execute the pipeline. The data will be cleansed during the copying process, and the cleansed data will be available in the Data Lake Store at the specified file location.

Please note that the above code is just a sample and is not guaranteed to run without modifications. Depending on the specific requirements, you may need to make changes to the pipeline definition, the transformations, and the data source/sink to meet the specific needs of your use case.

5. You can also add additional transformations to the pipeline as needed. For example, you can use the "Derived Column" transformation to create new columns based on the data in existing columns, or use the "Aggregate" transformation to aggregate data based on certain columns.


# Here is an example code snippet that adds a new column "TemperatureF" to the data, which is the temperature in Fahrenheit:

6. You can also add additional sink destinations if you want to store the cleansed data in multiple locations. For example, you can copy the data to an Azure SQL Database, a Power BI data set, or another Data Lake Store.

7. Once the pipeline is configured, you can run it on a schedule, or trigger it manually, to cleanse the data from the IoT Hub in real-time. You can monitor the pipeline execution to ensure that the data is being cleansed and transformed as expected.
